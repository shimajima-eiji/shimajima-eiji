# README

#Outward
A so-called Github repository for job hunting and job changes. <br>
Some are currently in operation.

Details later (according to README in each repository)

## [Github Pages](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/shimajima-eiji.github.io)
[Github Pages site](https://shimajima-eiji.github.io)

### [Hosting](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/Hosting)
-[Hosting route](https://shimajima-eiji.github.io/Hosting/)

Put something that is not the same as borrowing another site and publishing it.
<br> For personnel and scouts who want something that can be seen right now.

## [resume](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/resume)
Created for recruiting activities. GitHub for job hunting and changing jobs. <br>
[View appointment form and biographical information that can be published. ] (https://shimajima-eiji.github.io/resume/)

### [profile](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/profile)
If resume is outward, profile is inward, as the content to be registered.
I would like to consolidate it into resume, but since the operation of resume is so far so far, I am using it by cutting out only the necessary parts.

## [Snippets](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/Snippets)
It's for mixing jumbled sources towards services and agents that rank and evaluate in the source code of the GitHub repository. <br>
Different from GAS, there are some that are not in operation, and some that are in operation are partially used, so I intentionally divide them. <br>
Didn't such a measure be supposed when the service started? I doubt.

I feel that it is better to use various guides on GitHub Pages.

## [GAS](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/GAS)
A GAS-specific version of Snippets. <br>
It's in production, so I'm spinning off from Snippets. <br>

Again, I feel the need for GitHub Pages.

## [public_kh](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/public_kh)
Originally this was Snippets, but the purpose was for displaying blogs (iframes and the like). <br>
I want to integrate it in the future.

## [gist](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/gist)
A repository for managing gist. <br>
Though the idea is the same as Snippets, the management seems to be difficult to understand, so I decided to divide the repository.

## [revealjs-ck](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/revealjs-ck)
Make public slides crispy with Markdown (RevealJS). For Lightning Talk. <br>
Sometimes I use GitHub Pages, so I can't integrate it into my blog.

## [EntranceExam](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/EntranceExam)
I was just looking at the advertisement while being swayed by the train, so I put together a quick code. <br>
It's not competition programming, but I focused on assembling it quickly, so I'm not reviewing it.

## [man-month](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/man-month)
When I talked about changing the hourly wage ←→ monthly income ←→ I wish I could find out my annual income in one shot. <br>
[You can use it immediately after opening it in a browser. ] (https://shimajima-eiji.github.io/man-month/)<br>
Put manifest.json and use it as a chrome extension.

#Inward
I keep it because I want to use it.

## [Chocolatey](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/Chocolatey)
We will include everything that can be done with chocolatey and those that need to be set such as WSL and VS Code. <br>
You can also create a repository that is properly managed and aggregate it.

### [Qiita](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/Qiita)
I write like bookmarks or stock, but the operation is not fixed...
I think it was actually a good match to remember when I didn't see it later and when I "want to see bookmarks I deleted in the past". I noticed that it was adopted.
In terms of role, it is close to Chocolatey.vivaldi.webpanel (I haven't made such a thing for now).

## [AgreeDoc](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/AgreeDoc)
Contract related for freelance activities. <br>
It is a public repository because it is a template and needs to be shown to the client.
