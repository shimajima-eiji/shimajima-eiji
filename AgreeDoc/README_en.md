## Contract guide
[Basic contract] (https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/README/blob/master/AgreeDoc/docs/basic.txt)

-Business content
-Business period
-Reward amount
-Reward payment date
-Handling of delivered deliverables

And agree with the seal along with the changes to the contents of the basic contract.
The exchange of rewards can be stamped in writing (email or communication service is also possible), and if you save a part of each, it can be effective from that moment.
Please rewrite the [Individual Contract] (https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/README/blob/master/AgreeDoc/docs/individual.txt) for details.

In addition, Article 10 of the basic contract “Claims that continue even after the expiration of this contract” can be changed by individual contract.
Please be careful especially when you want to use the delivered products for other projects.

Please refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/shimajima-eiji/AgreeDoc/wiki) for auxiliary work other than document content creation.

# About non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
[I don't think NDA is valid](https://www.cloudsign.jp/media/20180521-nda-sosyou/), so I rarely make it when I'm the primary client. <br>
I use the same if the client I undertake as a vendor specifies that I have to get an NDA, but I don't feel the need as an individual. <br>
However, I have not neglected it.
